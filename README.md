General questions

What is AIPropertyScan and who is it for?  
Answer: AIPropertyScan analyzes a curb photo or address to identify exterior issues, estimate repair costs using regional baselines, rank fixes by expected ROI, and produce an exportable contractor scope. Ideal users: flippers, portfolio investors, real estate agents, homeowners, and contractors looking for scoped, budgeted leads.

How long does a report take?  
Answer: Most reports are ready in about 3 minutes from upload. We show a progress indicator while the analysis runs.

Do I need to sign up to try a sample?  
Answer: Yes. You can generate one free report after signing up. Saving, exporting, or running portfolio scans requires an account.

Reports and accuracy

What does the report include?  
Answer: Top fixes ranked by ROI; estimated cost ranges with confidence bands; projected resale or rental uplift; before/after mockups where available; and a contractor‑ready PDF scope listing tasks and budget ranges.

How accurate are the cost estimates and uplift projections?  
Answer: We use regional cost baselines and local comps to produce conservative ranges and a confidence indicator for each estimate. Estimates are designed to guide decisions and speed contractor quoting, not to replace an on‑site inspection.
